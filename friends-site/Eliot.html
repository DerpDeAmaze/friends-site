                <p>
                    Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you
                    And by now, you should've somehow realised what you gotta do
                    I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now
                    And backbeat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out
                    I'm sure you've heard it all before, but you never really had a doubt
                    I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now
                    And all the roads we have to walk are winding
                    And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
                    There are many things that I would like to say to you, but I don't know how
                    Because maybe
                    You're gonna be the one that saves me
                    And after all
                    You're my wonderwall
                    Today was gonna be the day, but they'll never throw it back to you
                    And by now, you should've somehow realised what you're not to do
                    I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now
                    And all the roads that lead you there were winding
                    And all the lights that light the way are blinding
                    There are many things that I would like to say to you, but I don't know how
                    I said maybe
                    You're gonna be the one that saves me
                    And after all
                    You're my wonderwall
                    I said maybe (I said maybe)
                    You're gonna be the one that saves me
                    And after all
                    You're my wonderwall
                    I said maybe (I said maybe)
                    You're gonna be the one that saves me (saves me)
                    You're gonna be the one that saves me (saves me)
                    You're gonna be the one that saves me (saves me)
